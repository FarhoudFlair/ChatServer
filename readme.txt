My application is inside the 'Chat Server' folder
The server you can run locally is inside 'Nodejs Chat Server'

Open the app using the workspace file then run the app and enter the address to the server in the message box at the top and press connect. Alternatively, you can run the node server included in the submission and connect by entering 'localhost:3000' as the server address.

You can disconnect via disconnect button.

Enter a message in the text field at the bottom and press send message to let everyone else in the server receive it.

ENHANCEMENT: Added a progress bar that will fill from empty to full to indicate the client connecting to a server. It will empty again when you disconnect.
